# Defer.run and RedwoodJS Example

An example of a [RedwoodJS](https://www.redwoodjs.com) app using [Defer](https://www.defer.run) to run background jobs.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo

2. See directory structure

3. Be sure to setup a DATABASE_URL and generate your Prisma client

```bash
yarn rw prisma generate
```

4. Sign up for Defer

5. Create an app and link to your repo

7. Set your `DEFER_TOKEN` if running locally and want to run hosted jobs

6. In defer build settings, in Advanced options add the Pre-build command:

```bash
yarn rw prisma generate
```

7. In defer build settings, in Environment variables set:

* `DATABASE_URL` to a connection string available in the cloud (ie, not local SQLite)
* `RESEND_API_KEY` to your [Resend](https://resend.com) api key in order to send emails
* `SEND_TO_EMAIL` to the email address you want mails sent

### Notes

* Prisma client must be generated and

```
yarn rw prisma generate
```

* If you want to use Redwood logger, be sure to set level to info since jobs run as production

```ts
export const logger = createLogger({ options: { level: 'info' } })
```

# README

Welcome to [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com)!

> **Prerequisites**
>
> - Redwood requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (>=18.x) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (>=1.15)
> - Are you on Windows? For best results, follow our [Windows development setup](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/how-to/windows-development-setup) guide

Start by installing dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Then change into that directory and start the development server:

```
cd my-redwood-project
yarn redwood dev
```

Your browser should automatically open to http://localhost:8910 where you'll see the Welcome Page, which links to many great resources.

> **The Redwood CLI**
>
> Congratulations on running your first Redwood CLI command!
> From dev to deploy, the CLI is with you the whole way.
> And there's quite a few commands at your disposal:
> ```
> yarn redwood --help
> ```
> For all the details, see the [CLI reference](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/cli-commands).

## Prisma and the database

Redwood wouldn't be a full-stack framework without a database. It all starts with the schema. Open the [`schema.prisma`](api/db/schema.prisma) file in `api/db` and replace the `UserExample` model with the following `Post` model:

```
model Post {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  body      String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}
```

Redwood uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), a next-gen Node.js and TypeScript ORM, to talk to the database. Prisma's schema offers a declarative way of defining your app's data models. And Prisma [Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/migrate) uses that schema to make database migrations hassle-free:

```
yarn rw prisma migrate dev

# ...

? Enter a name for the new migration: › create posts
```

> `rw` is short for `redwood`

You'll be prompted for the name of your migration. `create posts` will do.

Now let's generate everything we need to perform all the CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) actions on our `Post` model:

```
yarn redwood g scaffold post
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8910/posts/new, fill in the title and body, and click "Save":

Did we just create a post in the database? Yup! With `yarn rw g scaffold <model>`, Redwood created all the pages, components, and services necessary to perform all CRUD actions on our posts table.

## Frontend first with Storybook

Don't know what your data models look like?
That's more than ok—Redwood integrates Storybook so that you can work on design without worrying about data.
Mockup, build, and verify your React components, even in complete isolation from the backend:

```
yarn rw storybook
```

Before you start, see if the CLI's `setup ui` command has your favorite styling library:

```
yarn rw setup ui --help
```

## Testing with Jest

It'd be hard to scale from side project to startup without a few tests.
Redwood fully integrates Jest with the front and the backends and makes it easy to keep your whole app covered by generating test files with all your components and services:

```
yarn rw test
```

To make the integration even more seamless, Redwood augments Jest with database [scenarios](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/testing.md#scenarios)  and [GraphQL mocking](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/testing.md#mocking-graphql-calls).

## Ship it

Redwood is designed for both serverless deploy targets like Netlify and Vercel and serverful deploy targets like Render and AWS:

```
yarn rw setup deploy --help
```

Don't go live without auth!
Lock down your front and backends with Redwood's built-in, database-backed authentication system ([dbAuth](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/authentication#self-hosted-auth-installation-and-setup)), or integrate with nearly a dozen third party auth providers:

```
yarn rw setup auth --help
```
